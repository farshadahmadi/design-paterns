package main

// Some tasks need to be done. Our problem is that we want to do a repetitive sub task as part of all these tasks.
// For example, our tasks are transferring money and generating report. But we want to audit trail them. Meaning whenever
// a money transfer is done, it is recorded by an audit tail. Th same goes to generating report. So we have info who did what.
// Think about a solution to do that!

func main() {
	// do transfer money
	// do generate report
}
